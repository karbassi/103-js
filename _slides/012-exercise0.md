## Let's have our robot **move to** the point `(0, 0)`.

{: .fragment} 
**Move** your pencil to `(0, 0)` point on the grid

{: .fragment} 
**Move**  right by one square. This is `x = 10`.

{: .fragment} 
**Move**  down by one square. This is `y = 10`.

{: .fragment}
Our robot is on `(10, 10)` point now.

Remember, we are moving, not drawing.
